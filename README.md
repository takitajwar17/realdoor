## Overview

RealDoor is an intelligent platform designed to help users prepare, evaluate, and perfect their visa applications. Built as a high-performance Edge application, it runs entirely on Cloudflare Workers using OpenNext.

The platform provides users with **smart document checklists**, **AI-powered readiness evaluations**, and an **expert chatbot (Atlas)** to analyze their documents, highlight risks, and suggest improvements before they apply for their visas.

Production deploys are triggered from GitHub Actions on pushes to `main`.

## Core Features

- **Robust Authentication:** Email/Password and Google OAuth, powered by Lucia Auth.
- **Multi-tenancy & Teams:** Team-based architecture with system/custom roles, JSON-stored granular permissions, and complete tenant isolation.
- **AI-Powered Visa Tools:**
  - **Smart Checklists:** Dynamically generated document requirements based on destination and visa type.
  - **AI Evaluation:** Automated document review scoring, risk factor identification, and actionable recommendations.
  - **Atlas Chat:** An AI assistant that knows the user's specific application and documents, ready to answer questions and provide interview tips.
- **Admin Support Desk:** A built-in ticketing system for user inquiries and enterprise leads.
- **Edge Native:** Runs globally on Cloudflare Workers, utilizing D1 (SQLite), KV (Sessions/Caching), and R2 (File Storage).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 22.x
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.x (via Corepack is recommended)
- Optional: `nvm` or another Node version manager if you want to consume the repo’s `.nvmrc` version hint automatically.
- Optional: a global [Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/) install. The repo already pins `wrangler` in `devDependencies`, and the documented `pnpm` scripts use that version.

The repo includes `.nvmrc` and `package.json` `engines` to document the expected Node major as 22.

### 1. Clone & Install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vdc-mvp.git
cd vdc-mvp
corepack enable
# Optional, if you use nvm:
nvm use
pnpm install
```

### 2. Environment Setup

Create `.env` from the shipped example for plain `pnpm dev` and repo-local tooling:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

If you plan to run `pnpm preview` or any direct Wrangler-backed local flow, also create `.dev.vars`:

```bash
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars
```

Use the files as follows:

- `.env` is the input for `pnpm dev` and basic repo-local tooling.
- `.dev.vars` is only needed for Cloudflare-backed preview/testing (`pnpm preview` and direct Wrangler flows).
- `wrangler.jsonc` `vars` are for committed, non-sensitive Worker values.
- Put preview/runtime secrets in `.dev.vars` locally and in Cloudflare Worker secrets when deployed, not in committed `vars`.
- If you run remote Cloudflare deploy or remote Wrangler tooling from your machine, export `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and `DATABASE_ID` in your shell or load them with a tool such as `direnv`. The documented `pnpm` deploy/Wrangler commands do not automatically ingest `.env`.

For a basic local run, the baseline values are:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`

Everything else in the examples is either a deploy credential or an optional integration. Leave it blank until you actually need that feature.

### Cloudflare Deploy & Remote Tooling

- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and `DATABASE_ID` for production Drizzle, remote D1 tooling, and deploy flows.
- Provide them in your shell environment for direct `pnpm deploy*`, `wrangler`, or other remote Cloudflare commands.

### Optional Integrations

Only add these when you enable the feature:

- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` for Google SSO.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` for captcha-protected auth flows.
- `RESEND_API_KEY` for outbound transactional email.
- `EMAIL_FROM`, `EMAIL_FROM_NAME`, and `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` for sender identity.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` for AI features.

Optional diagnostics:

- `DB_SQL_LOG=true` to enable SQL query logging.

Deploy/release note: the default release path applies remote D1 migrations before code deploy. That assumes backward-compatible, additive schema changes. Breaking schema changes still need a two-phase rollout: deploy code that supports both shapes, migrate, then remove the old path in a later deploy.

### 3. Database Setup (Cloudflare D1)

The application uses Cloudflare D1 locally via Wrangler. The schema source of truth lives under `src/db/schema/`; `src/db/schema.ts` is only the compatibility barrel.

```bash
pnpm db:migrate:dev
```

Schema-change workflow:

1. Edit the relevant files under `src/db/schema/`.
2. Run `pnpm db:generate <name>`.
3. Review and commit the generated SQL migration plus the matching `src/db/migrations/meta/*` changes.
4. Run `pnpm db:migrate:dev` for local D1.
5. Remote D1 migrations are applied manually during release, not through a dedicated repo script.

### 4. Cloudflare Bindings (Types)

Generate TypeScript definitions for your Cloudflare environment variables and bindings:

```bash
pnpm cf-typegen
```

Run this after pulling or making `wrangler.jsonc` binding changes.

### 5. Start Local Development

For standard UI and App Router iteration, start the plain Next.js dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs `next dev -p 3000` and serves the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For Cloudflare-backed local preview/testing, use:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

Use `pnpm preview` when you need the built Worker runtime and Cloudflare bindings locally, such as D1/KV/R2-dependent behavior, webhook handling, or other binding-dependent flows.

## Architecture & Conventions

### Database & ORM

- We use **Drizzle ORM** with Cloudflare D1.
- **Important:** Cloudflare D1 currently does not support database transactions via Drizzle.
- IDs are auto-generated via CUID2 at the schema level. Never pass IDs manually when inserting records using `db.insert().values()`.

### Cloudflare Context

To access Cloudflare bindings (KV, D1, R2, Environment Variables) inside Next.js API routes or Server Components, use the provided context utility:

```typescript
import { getCloudflareContext } from "@/utils/cf-context";

const { env, cf, ctx } = getCloudflareContext();
```

### Cloudflare Bindings

The deployed Worker expects the following bindings for full feature parity:

- `APP_D1` is the app-facing D1 binding inside application code. The checked-in Worker entry maps it to Wrangler's `NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1` binding, which OpenNext still uses for tag-cache integration.
- `NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV` is the Next.js incremental cache KV binding.
- `NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE` is the Durable Object queue binding used by OpenNext.
- `ASSETS` is the static asset binding for the Worker bundle.
- `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` is the internal service binding for the Worker itself.
- `APP_KV` is the app KV namespace used by session/cache-related features.
- `R2` is the document storage bucket binding.
- `VECTORIZE` is the embeddings/index binding used by AI features.

These bindings are declared in `wrangler.jsonc`; run `pnpm cf-typegen` after config changes if you need updated generated types.

### Authentication

- **Server Components:** Retrieve the active session using `getSessionFromCookie()` from `src/utils/auth.ts`.
- **Client Components:** Retrieve the active session using `useSessionStore((state) => state.session)` from `src/state/session.ts`.

## Contributing

1. Create a new branch for your feature (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
2. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
3. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Open a Pull Request

**Coding Guidelines:**

- Prefer React Server Components (RSC) to reduce client JavaScript.
- Limit the use of `'use client'`, `useEffect`, and `useState`.
- Format code via Prettier/ESLint rules before committing.
- Do not add packages arbitrarily; use `pnpm` and check `package.json` for existing libraries first.
